# NER_transformer_HF
Use transformer model from Hugging Face Hub and fine-tune it for named entity recognition

In this project, we’ll develop a transformer model to recognize named entities such as persons, places, and organizations in the given input text.

We’ll work with Python libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and the Hugging Face Transformers library. We’ll preprocess our input text dataset to make it suitable for training a transformer model. Next, we’ll develop and train a small transformer model on the preprocessed dataset. Finally, we’ll pick a state-of-the-art trained transformer model from Hugging Face Hub and fine-tune it for named entity recognition. The project will require a text dataset as an input to the model. The expected output is an NLP model capable of accurately identifying entities in a given text.
